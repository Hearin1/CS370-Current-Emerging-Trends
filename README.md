# CS370-Current-Emerging-Trends

For this project, I developed a pirate intelligent agent using reinforcement learning and neural networks, showcasing my ability to apply these concepts to a real-world scenario. I was provided with foundational code that set up the environment and basic agent interactions, but I was responsible for implementing key aspects such as the reward function, training loop, and neural network architecture. Through iterative testing and optimization, I improved the agentâ€™s decision-making capabilities, ensuring it could learn effectively from its environment and adapt to different challenges. This hands-on experience reinforced my understanding of reinforcement learning principles and the importance of fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.

This project connects to the larger field of computer science by demonstrating how artificial intelligence can be used to solve complex problems through learning and adaptation. Computer scientists analyze problems, develop algorithms, and create software solutions that impact various industries, from automation to healthcare. Approaching problems as a computer scientist involves breaking them down into manageable components, utilizing computational thinking, and iterating on solutions through experimentation and refinement. By applying these problem-solving techniques, I was able to develop an intelligent agent that learned from its environment, mirroring real-world applications such as robotics and autonomous systems.

Beyond technical implementation, ethical considerations are crucial in the development of intelligent agents. As a computer scientist, I have a responsibility to ensure that the systems I create are fair, transparent, and do not cause harm to users or organizations. This includes considering potential biases in training data, ensuring the security and privacy of user information, and designing models that align with ethical guidelines. In this project, I reflected on how reinforcement learning models can influence decision-making and the importance of responsible AI development. Understanding these ethical implications will help me develop future technologies that are both innovative and aligned with ethical standards.
